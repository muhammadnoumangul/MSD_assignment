# MSD_assignment
This is an MSD task assignment.
There are three files
 a. Dockerfile
 b.EC2.txt
 c.main.py
main.py has the code that takes the file and prints out the top 10 most common successive words in the plain text

EC2.txt is the main text file. Which can be use as example as the plain textfile

Dockerfile is used to create the image of the Python script(main.py)

I have created docker image of this dockerfile and it is available on hub.docker.com
name of image: noumangul/python-msd1:python-msd1
